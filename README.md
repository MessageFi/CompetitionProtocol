[![Github license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/semaphore-protocol/boilerplate.svg?style=flat-square)]()

Competition protocol is an infrastructure to create on-chain events and secret ballets quickly, using ZK snarks technology to provide anonymous voting.

Competition protocol([original version][pre]) started from the [Eth Hong Kong Hackthon][hackthon hk] Otc. 2023 and won the second prize. Now, it is rebuilt by yarn and other features.
Here is the list of developing plans:
